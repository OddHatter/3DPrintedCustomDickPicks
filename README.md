3D Print Files for Custom Guitar Pick
I was inspired by https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2320184 but the design was not functional for me so I modeled my own. These are slightly larger than regular picks. I have included the SVG file as well as 2 STL's. customeDickPick.stl is just a single pick where as PickSheet.stl is a layout of 18 picks to fit on a 165mm x 165 mm print bed.
